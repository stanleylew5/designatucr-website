# Introduction
*By Peter Lu*

The goal for this summer is to deploy a new website for Design At UCR for the upcoming 2024-2025 year. Our website is essential for effective communication, increased visibility, resource sharing, and community building. It serves as a centralized information hub, presenting the organization professionally and attracting new members, collaborators, and potential sponsors. The idea is to expand our website capabilities beyond that of a static website that only displays org information, and instead expresses our design thinking, portfolio engagement, and networking opportunities. My goal is to help DAU build a stronger reputation by deploying a website that is significantly more centralized and platform-based, allowing easier access to resources and connections with students and industry.

This section will talk about the organization, website features, the development pipeline, and external resources to reference to get started.
