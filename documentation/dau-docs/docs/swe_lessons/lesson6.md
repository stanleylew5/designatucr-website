# DAU SWE Lesson 6

## Intermediate Javascript

Intermediate JavaScript will cover more concepts and programming paradigms related to development. This includes DOM manipulation, asynchronus JavaScript, and futher applications of objects and arrays.

These concepts are slighty more challenging but they help better understand how you can work with React and Nextjs better.They build on the foundational knowledge from the basics and introduce more complex and nuanced aspects of JavaScript that are essential for effective web development.

## Objects and Arrays

- Object literals
- Accessing and modifying object properties
- Array methods (push, pop, shift, unshift, map, filter, reduce)
- Iterating through arrays (for, forEach, for...of)
- Spread operator and destructuring
- DOM Manipulation

## Document Object Model (DOM) overview

- Selecting elements (getElementById, querySelector)
- Modifying elements (textContent, innerHTML, styles)
- Event handling (addEventListener, event objects)
- Creating and removing elements

## Asynchronous JavaScript

- Callbacks
- Promises
- async/await
- Fetch API for making HTTP requests
- Error handling in asynchronous code
