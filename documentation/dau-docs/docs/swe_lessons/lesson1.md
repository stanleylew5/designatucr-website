# DAU SWE Lesson 1

## Introduction to Web Development

We are working on building a full-scale platform for DAU over the summer and expecting to launch before the start of the fall quarter 2024. To prepare everyone, I am leading a series of lessons that go from beginner to intermediate web development that everyone can follow and utilize to contribute to the development of the platform.

Web Development or web dev is the job of building, maintaining, and testing websites and web applications. This usually involves working with mutliple team members in a project focused environment to meet client needs for a end product. Web developers solve problems, build complex and useful applications, and are constantly experiementing with new technologies. To start lets look at the basics of building a webpage because thats where all web developers start.

### Three building blocks of a Webpage

There are three building blocks that get you started with building a webpage.
Webpage is one single page of a website.

1. **HTML**

   - Hypertext Markup Language
   - Structures and defines content of our web page

2. **CSS**

   - Cascading Style Sheets
   - Styles and looks of our web page

3. **JavaScript**
   - Scripting or programming language
   - Adds interactivity to our web page

Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript (JS) is a programming language. It allows us to bring interactivity to our website such as:

- Event listening
- Communication between client and server
- Creating animations
- Building games
- Performing backend development

Building a strong foundation in JS early will make learning libraries and tools such as React,Nextjs much easier. Have a strong understanding of HTMl and CSS then javascript as someone new to web development!

We learn in this order because it's the simplest way to understand web development:

- The majority of time will be spent learning JavaScript
- HTML and CSS can be picked up along the way

At the end of the day, users are focused on what is delivered and displayed from the frontend development but backend implementations such as page loading, media queries, and keeping the website up and running matter as well,

Websites can be simply split into two layers: the frontend and backend. In software engineering, we use this split to create a separation of concerns. This results in three popular roles: Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, and Full-Stack Developer. Lets go over what each layer is and the respective roles.

### The Frontend

- Everything a user sees and interacts with visually
- Made of client-side interactions and the user interface
- Comprised of HTML, CSS, and JS
- Should represent a design idea or vision that attracts users
- Easy navigation, diverse usability, and visual appeal
- Technologies include: React, Angular, Vue

#### The Frontend Developer

- Develops the user interface and user experience
- Bridges the gap between the user (client) and backend (server)
- Tasks a frontend developer may work on:
  - Design and prototype UI
  - Creating style guides for brand identity
  - Translating static designs into a functional website
  - Responsive websites are everything
    - Optimally displayed for all screen types (mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Developing websites that function on all browsers
  - Creating accessibility for all functions of a website
    - Text and speech translation
    - Keyboard-only navigation
    - Color combinations and contrasts
  - Site performance and load time
  - Webforms and user data and information collection

### The Backend

- Hidden processes of a website application
- Storing and securely manipulating user data
- Made of server-side rendering and sending data to client interface
- Helps the frontend function smoothly
- Optimization techniques
- Algorithms and data structures

#### The Backend Developer

- Develops server-side rendering and application logic
- Handles database communication between client and server
- Tasks a backend developer may work on:
  - Handling client-side requests for data
  - Creating server-side scripts that fetch data from the server
  - Manages database integrity and security
    - Setting up a proper database
    - Maintaining the database
    - Protecting and securing user information
  - Improves speed of client-server communication
  - Implementing APIs supporting CRUD operations
  - Improving logic behind web apps
  - Making the frontend function optimally

#### The Full Stack Developer

- Develops both frontend and backend technology for a web app
- Broad range of knowledge of both layers
- Usually a senior role but sometimes junior
- Less specific and specialized in frontend and backend
- Experienced full stack developers are very good with expertise in either role

#### Conclusion

This lesson covered the roles and responsibilities in web development.
The next few lessons will cover learning HTML,CSS, and Javascript.
